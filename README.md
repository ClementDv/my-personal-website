## Description

This website presents me, my skills, my background and the most important projects of my training.</br>
I developed it to learn more about the web and new technologies like React and NextJs.</br>
I decided to leave it open source in order to show my work and the skills I was able to acquire in this project.

## Technologies

2. [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)
3. [Next js](https://nextjs.org/docs)

I used code formatter [prettier](https://prettier.io/) and code linter [eslint](https://eslint.org/).
